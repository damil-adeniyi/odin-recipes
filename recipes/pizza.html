    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza is a beloved dish originating from Italy, featuring a round, 
        flat base of dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients. 
        It is baked at high temperatures, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. The 
        combination of crispy crust, savory toppings, and melted cheese makes pizza a 
        favorite worldwide, perfect for any occasion from casual gatherings to festive
         celebrations.
